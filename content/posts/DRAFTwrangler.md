## Life as a Data Wrangler

**The information in this post is my personal journey. I aim to inform and share my experience with you â€“ the reader - to describe my experience as a Data Wrangler.**

### Background

During the final writing stages of [my PhD]({{< ref "the-phd" >}}) I started the job hunt! 
In May 2022, only a few days after completing the thesis, I began the Data Wrangling position at the University of Oxford.

I was located at the Big Data Institute (BDI) working on the Oxford-Novartis Collaboration.
The collaboration involved clinical trial studies on patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). [cite annie's paper https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8590765/] 

My role as a Data Wrangler was to produce derivations of the data for specific projects.

### Git

One of my major achievements was encouraging the use of GitLab in the wider team for reproducibility.

### RShiny

Another major outcome was the creation of the MS Data Dashboard

### Papers 

+ Ocampo, Alex, et al. "Prognostic factors for worsening and improvement in multiple sclerosis using a multistate model." Multiple Sclerosis Journal (2024): 13524585241275471.

### Wrapping-up

+ I've enjoyed exploring what Oxford has to offer!
+ My next role started immediately after in the same building as a Software Data Engineer.
