## Hello World - again!

{{< alert type="info" >}}
The original post was in 2023, however is updated as the site has upgrades.
{{< /alert >}}

I started this website journey around 2015 for university assignments: writing blogs for modules.
I decided to create my own `CSS` and `index` page to better structure my work.
In 2021, midway through my PhD, I progressed onto GitHub pages with `Bootstrap` and a terrible repo structure.
Now in 2023, I’ve decided to try [**`Hugo`**](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo website"). 

A few months ago - **in 2023** - with COVID, I decided to revamp the site and intended to go with the markdown-file route.
Whilst ill with the decision to improve the blog, I had some time off work, so my 5-day isolation weekend turned *somewhat* productive.

With the exception of some commands, `Hugo` uses markdowns allowing for many automated features.
My goal was to be **simple** - I didn't want to wrangle too much with `HTML` or design.

After some playing around with the `Hugo` features - I've come to appreciate the autonomy, usability, and markdowns.
To start, I spent hours looking at the [theme list](https://themes.gohugo.io/ "full list of Hugo themes") - choosing between themes that had features most important to me.

The design was a toughie. Many themes I explored were great, others relied on dependencies, and in the end, I was looking for something quite minimalistic.
I finalised on [`Monochrome`](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-monochrome/ "monochrome theme") as I liked the minimalistic design and responsiveness.
Though a top contender was [`PaperMod`](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/ "papermod theme").

**As of 2025**, this site is powered by [`Hugo️`](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo "hugo website") (v0.148.1) & [`Devise`](https://github.com/sap218/devise "my forked devise theme").
I forked the [Devise](https://github.com/austingebauer/devise "original devise theme") repository (v0.1.0)
