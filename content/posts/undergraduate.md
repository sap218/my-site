## Highlights of my Undergraduate degree

{{< alert type="info" >}}
Although this post was written in 2023, it is backdated to 2017.
{{< /alert >}}

I started my Undergraduate degree at [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/ "Aberystwyth University Computer Science site") in 2014.
Originally, I didn't plan on leaving Liverpool, but I was - thankfully - persuaded by an IT teacher, who sparked my interest in computers.

I discovered that I learn best through working examples and assignments. When it came to exam season, I did struggle a little.
With exams, to prepare I usually do revision in the repetition of past papers then compare my answers to "desired answers". 
But the department didn't release past papers and so I found an alternative through writing on cards and repetition of reading.
During my Masters, one lecturer taught via "live" coding sessions and personally, this was one of the best teaching experiences.

During the degree, we were taught various programming languages and so I wrote many lines of code (and words).
It's been a few years but I remember enjoying the Web programming, Machine Learning, and Arduino. And not-so-enjoyed Java.
The Figure below visualises this: both wordcount and lines of code peaked in my third and final year.
My most used language were web-based and - as mentioned - I couldn't figure out Java and so this was my least used language, having wrote a total of 31 lines...

My dissertation was a web project: students were to develop a site with a back-end database.
I spoke to my aunt and used their small cake business as inspiration.
See the Screenshot below of the final product front page.

A lot of fellow students used Bootstrap for the front-end design, however I wanted challenge myself and make this from scratch with CSS.
The website consisted of: a gallery of cakes, a mini-blog, an order system, and review form.
One piece of feedback, which I am very proud of:
> one of the best websites made from scratch

I graduated in 2017 and that Summer I started my research journey in a small [Bioinformatics]({{< ref "bioinformatics-project" >}} "bioinformatics blog") project. 
Afterward, I went on to study a [Masters degree]({{< ref "masters-dissertation" >}} "masters blog") in Data Science.
My [undergraduate dissertation](https://github.com/sap218/misc/blob/master/undergraduate_dissertation.pdf "undergraduate dissertation") is available to read.
