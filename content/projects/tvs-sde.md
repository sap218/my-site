## Thames Valley and Surrey Secure Data Environment (**TVS SDE**)

As a Software Data Engineer in the TVS SDE team, I've contributed to various aspects of the mission, most notably:

+ Developer of the **Cancer Mart**, including schema design and mapping to numerous databases and [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html "link to fhir documentation") terminology.
+ Programmed the SDE's [DICOM uploader](https://github.com/sap218/xnat_uploader "link to git repo for the xnat uploader") - involves zipping and uploading radiology scans to the SDE's [XNAT](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1385/NI:5:1:11 "link to xnat paper") server.

Check out the [TVS SDE's site](https://thamesvalleyandsurreyhealthandcaredata.nhs.uk/using-patient-data/thames-valley-and-surrey-secure-data-environment/ "link to the TVS SDE site") for more information.
