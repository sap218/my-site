## Banging Playground

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
Read at your own cringe - I made this poem when I was 11 years old (2007) for English class (I was notoriously terrible at poems).
{{< /alert >}}

It's foggy, we're drowsy, with the sound of bangs;
We're crawling around the best we can.

Shouting, exploding, and pushing to the limit;
It's raining mud, the sun seems timid.

Sweaty, dizzy, and confused;
The youths are rising and all bruised.

Smoggy gas shading a purple and green light;
Reaching for my gas mask as my chest becomes tight.

Blinded by fog, he's having a fit;
We're all struggling in this gas pit.

Short of breath, he was found;
Clutching his chest, falling to the ground.

Wagon pulls up, and bodies thrown;
Some pray for him as he still groans.

Spitting out blood, the spasms perish down;
Wishing I saved him, there's no more sound.

A man of honour and my friend;
Unfortunately now, it's the end.

Because of me, he's not alive;
I'm no hero, he didn't survive.

Blood everywhere and ear banging sounds;
It's no fun, this is the devil's playground.

It's been years since that day;
I still cry at night, calling for mayday.

I've edited this poem a little since to make it grammar good.
